### sacCer3_Del

The provided `sacCer3_Del` uses the set of yeast gene coordinate intervals and will be appropriate for most sacCer3-based datasets that perform full-gene knockouts (e.g. any [YKOC strain][ykoc-paper]). Mappability scores were pregenerated using the scripts provided in `DeletionID/utility_scripts/`.

The next page includes more information on how to use the utility scripts to download and customize your reference files.
