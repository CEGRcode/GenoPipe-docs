## Pregenerated VCF sets

We provide some formatted yeast and human databases that come with the StrainID tool.

### sacCer3_VCF

These 12 strain reference files were generated using the `StrainID/utility_scripts/generate_sacCer3_VariantDB.sh` script which builds new VCF files from the VCF files generated by [Song et al (2015)][song-etal]. The chromosome naming system was converted from the roman numeral system to the arabic numeral system and the VCF files were subsetted to only include unique variants. In other words, only keep the variants from a strain file if they do not appear in any of the other 11 strain VCF files.
