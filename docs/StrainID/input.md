## Input(`-i`)
StrainID takes a directory pathname for the input and will run StrainID on all the BAM files (`*.bam`) it finds within that directory path when you execute `identify-Strain.sh`.

:::caution
It is extremely important that the BAM files provided match the reference genome build that the VCF files are based off of.
