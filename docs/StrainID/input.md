# Input(`-i`)
StrainID takes a directory pathname for the input and will run StrainID on all the BAM files (`*.bam`) it finds within that directory path when you execute `identify-Strain.sh`.

:::caution
Input BAM files, VCF reference files, and Genome reference files all NEED to be based on the same genome build. Do not mix and match for this!
